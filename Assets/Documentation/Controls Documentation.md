	This document will explain how to use the Online Ramsey program.

Menu Controls -
	Move the node along the wheels to select your builder and painter strategies.  The outer wheel contains the builder strategies and the inner wheel contains the painter strategies.  Once you select a strategy, feel free to change the parameters for that strategy in the submenu on the left.  Press the GO button in the middle to start the game.

	The User Builder and User Painter are the only strategies where the player must make a move using the controls listed in the other documented.  Every strategy besides User Builder and User Painter is automatic.  Also, there's a duplicate Random Painter but that's just to make the wheel look nicer.
