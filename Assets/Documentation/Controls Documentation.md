This document will explain how to use the Online Ramsey program.

## Menu Controls

The main menu is built up of two selection wheels, various parameter inputs, and a "go" button.

Move the node along the wheels to select your builder and painter strategies: the outer wheel contains the builder strategies and the inner wheel contains the painter strategies. 

Once you select a strategy, feel free to change the parameters for that strategy in the submenu on the left, if there are any. Press the `GO` button in the middle to start the game.

The User Builder and User Painter are the only strategies where the player must make a move using the controls listed in the other documented.  

Every strategy besides User Builder and User Painter is automatic. There may be duplicate strategies present in order to ensure an even number of entries per wheel.
