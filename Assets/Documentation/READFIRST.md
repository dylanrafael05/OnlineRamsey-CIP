	This document will explain the overarching use of the Online Ramsey program.  This program's purpose is to model the Online Ramsey problem.

Online Ramsey Problem Explanation -
	The Online Ramsey Problem is a game where a Builder and Painter play against each other on a set of infinite nodes.  While there are many variants of this game, this paragraph will explain the specific variant our program analyzes.  The Builder's goal is to make the game end as quickly as possible, while the Painter's goal is to prolong the game for as long as possible.  The game is turn-based, and a turn is comprised of a Builder move followed by a Painter move.  The Builder builds an edge between any two nodes that aren't already connected.  The Painter then paints it either red or blue.  The game ends when there is a monochromatic path of length N, where N is an input to the game.  Of course, since we can't have an actual graph of infinite nodes in our program, nodes will be created when needed.

	The most important part of this project for anyone looking to edit it or make additions is the "Gameplayer" folder (Scripts -> Gameplayer).  It contains the Builder and Painter strategies.  For more information on how this system works and how to create new strategies, look to the Gameplayer Documentation.md" file in the directory you found this file.  For controls and how to use the program itself, look to the "Controls Documentation.md" file also contained in this directory.
